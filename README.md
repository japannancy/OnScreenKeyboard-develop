On Screen Keyboard
==================

The Keyboard
-----------
I have made the keyboard layout editable. The default keyboard layout is the one given in the original Readme. In the interest of time, I have not opted to capture the many exceptions that could be raised from allowing this functionality. I merely did this to show that my design is flexible.

Test Individual Lines
---------------------
It is possible to test a single line by adding it to the text box next to the "Process String" button. The keyboard path output will be placed in the text block below. The path of the keyboard is dependent upon the keyboard layout being used.

Test File
---------
Select a test file by clicking on the "Select File" button. This will open up the windows explorer for you to select a file. Once a file is selected, click "Process File". This will place the keyboard path output into "output.txt" in the current folder (either Debug or Release).

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to talking with you about my design in the near future.
